      "The police then entered the bedroom, shouting at me saying that I had to leave even though I had nowhere to go and if I didn't, they would arrest me.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was assaulted and the police are aware of the history of domestic abuse, having arrested her multiple times. I have an IDVA and she was attending a perpetrator course.

      "I need help. Idk what to do. Idk how to make this brief. Believe me even though it is so long it is not inclusive of some of the worst parts. It’s the best I can do, and you will just have to take my word for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "TLDR: I’m afraid of my ex husband, I can’t get a protective order, and I don’t know how to relax and live a normal life,..\n",
      "\n",
      "My ex husband of 13 years was having an affair with my accountant. We separated in July 2022. He is wealthy but was also hellbent on doing whatever it took to wipe me from existence to protect his money and just generally washing his hands of me I guess. He spent six months scheming with her thinking he could walk away with our two children and leave me for dead. He was emotionally abusive and did some pretty egregious things but never physically harmed me. I did not have a problem with him leaving because I would have never left even though I wanted to. I had no idea what I was in for though. For some reason I thought this would be amicable.\n",
      "\n",
      "He set it up to fabricate outrageous stories to get sole custody, no visitation, he had somehow tricked me into signing my rights away from our house, he had isolated me and I had nowhere to go, he was incredibly cruel. I was completely and utterly unprepared for this level of cruelty. He filed a false police report and I was arrested for spousal battery (ironically it was because I was defending myself from being hit with an object and pushed that object out of the way. There was no contact made with him or his body. That’s another story) The district attorney found it to be absurd and immediately released me but not before I was dropped from the hiring process at my new job which was coincidently in that jail. The cruelty I was subjected to almost killed me. I experienced some incredible lows and honestly this is the most traumatic things I’ve ever experienced. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway he did not succeed in getting the house or sole custody. We got 50/50 custody and due to the loss of my job he was ordered to pay $3000 per month in spousal and child support (this lasted very little time because I ended up voluntarily lowering it but that’s another story) \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway that was almost 3 years ago. It has not stopped. We have been in and out of court and the judge in our case has made some shocking statements and rulings. I went through a short period of being verbally abusive in response to 40 instances of custodial interference. (No good excuse but using my children as leverage to hurt me or whatever brought out the worst in me. I have not engaged in verbal abuse for about 2.5 years.) He was completely torturing me and financially abusing me. Refusing to give me money to buy groceries (before support was ordered and after he stopped supporting the kids) unless I conceded my stake in his retirement. Just outrageous behavior. But in court the judge said I was acting like a “meth head with a third grade education” and essentially ordered me to respect him as the father of my children with no mention of how he could respect me as the mother. This man when having his request for order denied stood up in open court and screamed at the judge that “you are WRONg! I won’t do it and you will have to arrest me!!!” There was no response to this at all whatsoever. The worst thing I said to him was that he was a sorry excuse for a father )still wrong but why am I the one that gets admonished in court?) This was also when the judge ordered him for the THIRD time to attend therapy with our boys. He went on to violate that order for the third time. We go back to court. All I want is for my mentally ill child to see a therapist. (In California you have to have fathers consent to get any mental health treatment). The judge said to Me “you are not doing what is in the best interest of your children.” The only request I had was for him to ensure my children got therapy. On another occasion I voluntarily took a high conflict parenting class and at the next appearance I asked the judge to order him to do as well. He did. The following appearance the judge said to him “I want to commend you, sir, for taking the parenting class.” He was ordered! I did it voluntarily, with no prompting, and that was never said to me. Anyway, he still isn’t taking them to therapy. And I can’t go back to court because the judge said if I did he would open a CPS investigation. (I feel this is inappropriate)\n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway here we are nearly three years later. For the last 19 months he has had a growing fixation over my cats because one time my son left his backpack on the floor and the cat peed on it. Which is exactly why I’ve told him 100 times not to put it there… he had continuously harassed me about it. He even brought it up in court and the judge told me to take care of the problem (that didn’t exist but whatever.) he was telling anyone who would listen, slandering me in the community, that I was sending my kids to school smelling like cat urine. I was thinking, Am I crazy??? I went to the school and asked them if this was a concern, like maybe I’m nose blind??? But no there have been zero concerns.\n",
      "\n",
      "This continued and in October (after like 16 months of harassment, the obsessing over my cats) my attorney finally put an end to it. She came and inspected my house (probably thinking I just am oblivious to a real problem, because why is he going so hard on it??) and confirmed that my house is perfectly fine and told his attorney to stop. And he did. \n",
      "\n",
      "In November he lost his battle for support. (He wanted me, a single mother, to pay him, he was hiding income from three businesses, he has his income and his wife’s income) AND I voluntarily cut it in half but he literally wanted me to pay him when he disclosed $20,000 per month (not including the $15-20,000 ish dollars from his businesses) against my $4,000. If you’re not from California this may seem like a lot. It’s below the poverty line. Ultimately he finally realized that he was being unreasonable when his attorney declined to participate in a trial, and accepted by offer which was to reduce his child support by half (well below californias guideline) This is important. \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway, backing up for a second, he was my landlord up until June because that was my only place to live (this is another complicated explanation) and it was just another way to abuse me. I escaped and got my own place. That prompted a shift in the tides. His behavior became kind of bizarre. He was insanely rude and demanding, asserting dominance whenever he could, trying to get control, and that behavior has escalated. (I really think it was because when I moved out it severed that last string allowing him the satisfaction of retaining control. Now he couldn’t show up at my home uninvited, randomly inspect the house, come over when I had dates over, and find things to twist into ammunition. \n",
      "\n",
      "By the way he is a police officer and I truly believe this plays a significant role. I just simply do not believe much of these outcomes would have occurred if he was a construction worker\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the support hearing came to an end things really started to escalate further. He has been intolerably ugly. He has repeatedly violated court orders knowing there is nothing I can do. Custodial interference, trespassing, harassment, and other little things that have evolved from court orders….it has required tremendous restraint to not react explosively \n",
      "\n",
      "Until yesterday I really just thought he was being obnoxious for no reason and I just had to accept it. We had another issue I won’t waste time explaining but I indicated that I intended to file a custody modification request go readjust the holiday schedule which he did not like. Three days later, I get a call from CPS wanting to inspect my house as a result of a report that there is cat urine and feces all over my house. “Anonymous.” \n",
      "\n",
      "I was like absolutely come right over. Of course there is zero cat urine or feces anywhere. It took her three minutes to close the case. But even though she wouldn’t tell me who it was she read the report to me and it is obvious that either he reported it or he got someone to do it for him, of this I have no doubt. If you want further explanation I can respond to a comment. and he even referenced himself in the report. It is a crime here to make a false cPS report. I’m a terrible housekeeper. My house is not immaculate, it’s clean and healthy. No cockroaches or mice, no mold, no dirty dishes, I mop at least once a week and there is certainly no animal waste hanging around. \n",
      "\n",
      "I’m realizing now it’s not going to stop and it has just escalated and escalated. He is not just a cop, he is a cop that has used excessive force and has been the center of multiple “unsubstantiated” complaints. He has said some things to me in confidence about his practices, his opinions, and his actions that, if said out loud, there would be civil rights action. He has demonstrated the capacity to be violent and/or manipulative in a way that even at the cost of destitution or risk of calamity, he will go to any lengths to protect his money or wipe away any existence that he doesn’t like or finds the least bit inconvenient. He has leveled accusations of domestic violence, child abuse, drug abuse, mental illness, alcoholism with no regard to how it effects the kids, he has even at one point tried to pay me to abandon the kids ($2000.‘ I know this so ridiculous). He cut off my access to bank accounts and made me quit my job (before I knew what he was doing) to deplete my resources to hire an attorney and when I begged him to not take my children he said “Jessica, I have money, I have family, I am established, and I have a job. You have none of that and I will take the kids” he put me through a mother’s worst nightmare and is continuing,\n",
      "\n",
      "Now all of this to say I am scared. I don’t know if that’s reasonable: I really don’t but it is true. I believe, with no shadow of a doubt, I would already be dead if murder was legal. My best insurance policy is that if I had a heart attack people would believe he poisoned me. Not only have I posted on social media about it to create this insurance, but we live in a small town where our feud was a little bit public. \n",
      "\n",
      " I am not convinced that his behavior stops at “welp guess she isn’t an unfit mother, better leave her alone.” His behavior has become unpredictable and I feel like the family law system, well, that particular judge, has contributed to the abuse by allowing him to abuse me and commit literal crime while leveling insults and admonishments at me for him to witness. His behavior has not risen to the level of granting a restraining order and it would be that judge to decide any way. My lawyer is not supportive of making any kind of request for intervention basically because she knows I’ll lose. I live in a small county where there is only one family law judge. Disqualifying this judge or getting a new judge is not an option.\n",
      "\n",
      "Idk what to do. Idk if I need support, advice, idk. Please please please be kind. I’m terrified, my nerves are frayed, I’m exhausted from 3 years of him being heavily investment in my life falling apart, and I’m still reeling from the stress of the CPS visit and the fact that this is my life. I am not perfect. We were both unhappy apparently. I struggled with mental illness up until 2019 when I became medicated, earned my PhD, started a business, and learned to stick up for myself. I didn’t keep the house clean enough for him, I was irresponsible with money ( no excuse for that.) but he never had to figure out what he was going to eat every day. He got out of the shower every morning to his clothes laid out. I raised our kids without him helping, I did not do anything to deserve the cruelty. I guess I deserved my marriage to end. I guess she was better than me. Whatever but I did not deserve this, I will never trust a man..:maybe anyone enough to depend on a person ever again. \n",
      "\n",
      "So sorry this was so long. I’m literally falling apart. \n",

      "I have been married to my husband for over 12 years, together for 11. Things started out great and after I had our son and got married, everything went downhill. There had been issues before that but nothing that wasn't normal. There has been several issues of DV over the years. I have lost all my friends and support with the exception of my mom who has her own battles to deal with and who is bipolar. I have 3 kids. 2 from a previous relationship and the youngest is ours. I am not working due to the major hit my depression and anxiety has taken over the years and because of my kids health issues. Especially my youngest. Nothing major but it just seems to be one thing after another. My youngest also has ODD. Now to fast forward. December of 2023 my husband assaulted me. It was pretty bad, the worst he had ever done. I was left with several bruises, marks on my neck from him using his hands around my throat and I had been punched countless times on my head. He had tackled me into a dirty kitty litter box and unfortunately my 2 youngest had came in at the tail end. I called the cops and he was arrested. He has several charges. He was ordered to do multiple classes and pay fines, etc. etc. Which to this day he hasn't done any of it. Now here is where people will get mad. I stayed. I had no money, no support, nowhere to go. Where I live you can get 1 maybe 2 days of shelter and the next county over offers shelter but would not accept my older 2 because they are boys. (Doesn't seem fair but I guess I understand.) Like an idiot I let him back in. There was no \"honeymoon\" stage. Life kept moving on like nothing ever happened. I'm still in shock even after all this time. We had to move and we're still not done moving. Remember all that stuff my husband was supposed to do for court? Well, he didn't and now he has to turn himself in on Friday to serve 3 months. I have no idea what I'm going to do. I did have a counselor but she dropped me. I do have a psychiatrist. 2 of my kids have surgeries coming up within the next 3 weeks. We're on HUDVASH because my husband is a veteran. I mouned the loss of my marriage a long time ago. I have no issues with leaving him or him going to jail but I'm at a loss as to what to do to keep me and my kids from becoming homeless. Where do I start? Husband going to jail seems like a blessing and a curse. I have no one and nowhere to turn. There's all the help in world for him but not for us if we leave. I don't even know who to turn to in my area because housing is linked with veterans housing. I don't want to tip him off. I have 5 days until he goes in and we barely found out less than a week ago that his time was up. Any advice? Ideas? Please be gentle...\n",

      "Text: Married to a man 8 years older than me, we got pregnant with our first child while I was dating someone. He was fine for awhile, we even got an apartment together. The problem started when he started partying hard with his unemployed brother, the apartment complex complained about their noise on the veranda all the time and our new born crying. They eventually evicted us for multiple violations. I thought he would find a home for us but he didn't talk to us much and I had to sleep on friends couches with my son. After a few years and little contact, my dad bought me a trailer to live in. I explained the situation and he agreed to move in with us so we could be a family. We even got pregnant with a second child, and I thought everything would work out. Around new years of 2022, we went out to a bar to celebrate and decided he wanted to drink somewhere else with random young people he met. I didn't want to go so I told him I was going home. Much later that night he showed back up at the trailer, drunk and angry. He said the \"kids\" kicked him out of their car and he had to walk home. When I tried to explain he shouldn't have  gone with them to begin with, he pinned me against the wall. I was in shock, I haven't even told my friends and family about this save one person. The next few months he pretended as if nothing was wrong and he didn't remember doing it. Until my ex showed up in our town, I assumed I would just have to accept my new life. But then he proposed. My family was joyous of us finally tying the knot and publicly but I had reservations. I wasn't able to financially survive on my own or take care of our children alone, so afraid of another attack or not I stayed and we got married. My one friend tells me I should be afraid of him drinking too much and recently he had a moment where he got drunk and angry to the point I feared for my life like last time so I went to their house to cry and have my infant child be safe. I keep telling myself people can change, because they can right?\n",

      "I’ve been with a narcissist or psychopath whatever he may be, on and off for over five years. This relationship has been nothing more than just toxicity, filled with many forms and kinds of abuse. I was never aware of any of this when we first met. I know growing up I was abused many of the same ways, however when we met I fell head over heels that very same day. I mean it was crazy never before has ever happened to me. So ff, we split from living together in 2022. He began dating yet always came back and I couldn’t not love him he was the love of my life. Always going back. I got my own place Jan 2023, diagnosed with breast cancer, and left for the wolves. God told him he couldn’t be even my friend and I needed to be alone. Crushed I was again. On and on Dec. 23, he lost his house, the other girl he’s not allowed at her parents house because the way he acts and is. So second option has always been me. Never talks about anything or anyone but her, before her when we met it had been another past girl always spoken about never once they way he “claimed to love me”. Anyhow I lost that apartment 4 months later because of the arguments, he had already been in jail for other things not having to do with us. I get a house, well he calls the day before he leaves jail and I’m trying to move with no shit luck that day. I’m already on edge and rushed to make a rational decision I wasn’t ready to and agreed for him to come to my new home on bail conditions. Not happy about it, this was summer 2024. Not even 30 hours later I’m kicking him out, this went on all summer, mostly because I’m hip to it won’t allow it and know his lies, manipulation tactics and refuse to allow that kind of abuse anymore. Ff Nov. 2024, I had been woken up 3 times by him standing over me screaming twice because he wants his drugs that I keep so he doesn’t go crazy or do to much. The 3rd time same thing plus something wrong with his foot or something. I get up yelling back , grab my purse to leave which had an axe in it also. It was ripped off my arm he took the axe out and screaming and yelling. I backed against the wall on the footboard of my bed as he began swinging this axe 1 foot away from my head screaming he was going to kill me and chop me up, i grabbed my phone to call 911 and was told with and axe going back and forth that if I called the cops the he would not stop chopping me up into pieces until they got they’re. I had never in my life been so scared and thinking this is it he’s actually really going to kill me this time. I was in shock screaming to stop and I didn’t do anything why is he doing this. He said so many times I was going to die I don’t know how many times the axe went by my head but my footboard was chopped and two big holes in my wall. The axe went flying into my trash can. Still scared to death I begged to go to the bathroom where he followed me and began kicking my door and destroyed the door while screaming in my face so close his spit on landing on me my face and legs. I was froze and not even able to get off the toilet. I began to pray and ask God to save my life tonight please God don’t take me like this. After 30-40 minutes in the bathroom there was a knock at my door. He says the state police were there. OH MY GOD, the relief I felt for a split second. They came in and I refused to say a word until I knew he was in cuffs or not able to get back into my house. I was assured he wouldn’t. Hysterical barely able to breathe I tried to talk. I took out my phone and well don’t you know there had been an emergency call going for over 40 minutes. How I have no idea I don’t remember pressing the call button but by the grace of God I did and my life had been spared that night. \n",
      "With this all being said I have since lost my home which makes two in less than a year due to allowing him around my life, he ONLY GOT, harassment and simple assault two misdemeanor charges for this. He went to jail and got out Dec31, 2024???? How the hell is any of this possible? It’s not fair, I’m scared daily he’ll come finish me off. Continues to contact me and I’m scared to do anything at all. The law has never ever ever done me any justice whatsoever. The ADA Already lied to me and this man needs to pay for once in his life. I’m beginning to find my voice somewhat and ready to put my foot down for us women who don’t get the justice we deserve and have to live in fear for so long. Sorry for the long post but I’m ready to get this started go somewhere with it and have these laws made into something more strict upon domestic violence. It is past time that we take a stand not only for ourselves but our children and families that are affected by this too. We have suffered to long in silence and a man like this is very well capable of killing and believe he will if given the chance. Any of them can and will. They get a slap on the wrist with barely any jail time, some probation with conditions. Do you really think they give a shit about a piece of paper? Absolutely not. If they want us dead we will be dead. So as women who have suffered long enough, lived in fear to long, kept the silence for their abuser, how about we stand up for us and the next woman who is just got attacked, is going to get attacked killed, or doesn’t even know that it could happen to her too? We are more powerful, strong and capable of defending ourselves and getting the laws changed, corrected, fixed, harsher punishments something anything for the sake of our life, being mothers, our children, and families. We will not stand for this anymore. Who’s in with me I can’t do this alone and can’t fight it by myself. Please help me stand up to this for once. It’s time and I know it is. \n",

I avoid calling law enforcement at all costs, and now I feel he's taken advantage of that. Once I dialed, I told myself I would only press send if he came back to continue escalating things. No sooner than dialing, there he was in the doorway, so I pressed send and showed him my screen. I already couldn't breathe, he just flung all of my things around, so I couldn't find my inhaler and it hurt to even try to breathe. He quickly left once he knew I was calling them. However before he left, he shut the water off to the house. It's his house, I have been going through hell for months moving my stuff out and psychologically, he's made sure it's been a torturing process. I just want to get myself and my babies out of this mess peacefully! What should I do to have water for them in the meantime? I'm still frantic over the whole thing and having to make that choice, but I give him no reasons to behave the way he does, yet he will make a reason on his own everytime. \n",

I change duty stations every 3 years. My job has unpredictable hours so when I come home from work my ex would automatically fight me for my phone to see who I was talking to that day. If he saw a dudes name he would beat me if I came home 5 minutes later or earlier the next day he would beat me. He had my location and if it stopped somewhere he didn’t know he would beat me. I went through 6 phones in one month due to him constantly breaking them. The cops had been called 4 times and every time they wouldn’t do anything and then I would get beat after they left. I went to the hospital multiple times as well. Well fast forward a year and I went on deployment (it saved my life) he accused me of cheating on him when he was the one cheating and stole everything I owned while I was gone. Hacked into my social media accounts, emails, and my bank accounts, opened credit cards in my name. He racked up 45,000 dollars in debt in my name. I got the cops involved and 2 years later we have 5 charges against him and 2 warrants for those charges but the cops don’t know where he is so they can’t serve him. I have a protection order against him for 5 years which he keeps breaking by contacting me. He has been harassing me and my family and friends through Facebook messenger for the last 2 years. I guess what I’m wanting to know is how do I go about getting him to leave me and my family alone so I can move on in my life? Thanks in advance for any advice \n",

Of course she was afraid to get the MP's involved during the night of terror.  \n",

We didn't live together for those two years even though we were still seeing each other. I rented a room from a male friend and his girlfriend about 6 months ago. Things were going good and I was finally fixing my life. I was no longer homeless or living in my car with my two dogs. Eventually he met my friend and idk what happened but he told him he could move in. My husband was like how he was when we first met. He even stopped doing fentanyl.the one thing I despise since it killed my brother a year ago. Things were great at first until he started destroying the beautiful house my friend had. Smiling in his face and talking behind his Back. Well I figured out my so called friend was a woman abuser and just kicking the crap out of his girlfriend not caring who was around. Two months of yelling screaming and fist fighting then I had enough. My husband also started being abusive again ,not hitting me,but yelling at me in public, calling me names and just completely treating me like dirt. In the name of love though he convinced me to sell my Nissan rogue with promises of getting a new vehicle within a week. Never happened. Then his dad bought him a car and Everytime we would get in a fight he would yell at me to get out of he was gonna rip me out by my hair. Needless to say I moved our with and my two dogs with the promise of an apartment within a month. Never happened. It's summer and we all were living in the car. He would park at different parking lots and be gone for hours while my dogs and I boiled in the heat. We originally were supposed to go camping for a month.necer happened. Moral is u face up my car,my home and my sense of security because I lived him and Trusted him. I am online resaler and am actually not bad at it. He has intentionally tried to sabotage that to.I'm on social security and that is my only sense of security I've still got. As of today we finally got the campground for two days but he. Has completely abandoned me here. Idk what to do. I gave up everyone I was close to for him so I literally have noone to turn to. My dogs are like my children. They never leave my side. How can I fix what I let him do to me . I'm emotionally drained, physically exhausted and ready to give up. I feel defeated and I really believe he did all this for reveicause I moved in with my male friend and his girlfriend. What should I do?\n",
